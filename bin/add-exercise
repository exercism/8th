Your next steps are:
- Create the test suite in 'exercises/practice/${slug}/test.8th'
  based on the canonical data at 'https://github.com/exercism/problem-specifications/blob/main/exercises/${slug}/canonical-data.json'
  - Any test cases you don't implement, mark them in 'exercises/practice/${slug}/.meta/tests.toml' with "include = false"
- Create the example solution in 'exercises/practice/${slug}/.meta/example.8th'
- Verify the example solution by running 'bin/test-no-docker ${slug}'
- Create the stub solution in 'exercises/practice/${slug}/${slug}.8th'
- Update the 'difficulty' value for the exercise's entry in the 'config.json' file
- Validate CI using 'bin/configlet lint'
